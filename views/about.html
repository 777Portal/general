    <h1>Hi, this is weird.</h1>

    <p>sorry. i had to say it. its hard for me to describe myself.</p>

    <p>Im currently going by Sydney, but i change a lot. its hard for me to stay static, which is why i didn't use pages <b>(badumdish)</b></p>

    <p>I like Chinese street cats, and you should too.</p>
    <p>My favorite cat from the CSC's, is <a href="https://streetcat.wiki/index.php/Mr._Doom">Mr.Doom</a>, as he reminds me of myself, and is just awesome</p>

    <br>

    <p>I also like making art. most of it is bad unfortuantely, but thats part of the process (hopefully)</p>
    <p>i make most of it physically but i've thought about making digital stuff aswell.</p>
    
    <p>thats pretty much it. i made this as a personal website. I've made a few others, but this one i really want to just be whatever the heck i want, even if it isn't sleak or modern. basically a testing ground (kinda)</p>
